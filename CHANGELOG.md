and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- [#50] Make sure we protect against rewrapping a metapath finder's exec_module function.

### ## [0.1.0.dev10] - 2021-02-24
### Fixed
- Choose the output directory on startup, make sure it's an absolute path.

### ## [0.1.0.dev9] - 2021-02-23
### Added
- Use tox for testing multiple versions of Python.

### Changed
- Relax the python version requirement to 3.5.

### Fixed
- Fix handling of builtin functions assigned as attributes of a class. They look like
  static methods, (i.e. `isinstance(m, (staticmethod, types.BuiltinMethodType))` is
  `True`), but they don't have a `__func__` attribute.

### ## [0.1.0.dev8] - 2021-02-22
- [#27] Capturing HTTP requests and responses when testing Django apps.

## [0.1.0.dev7] - 2021-02-18
### Added
- [#26] Capturing SQL queries when testing Django apps.

## [0.1.0.dev6] - 2021-02-16
### Added
- [#17] Add elapsed attribute to ReturnEvent
- [#8] Add git to metadata
- pytest integration
- Support `APPMAP_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable. If set, specifies the root directory
  for writing AppMaps. If not set, defaults to `tmp/appmap`.

### Changed
- Added `About` section to the README

- Python 3.9.0 is now the minimum supported version.

- Use repr() instead of str() for receiver

  Use repr() instead of str() to get a string representation of an event's receiver. This
  works properly for flaskbb, and seems more correct in general.

  Also, add Event.__repr__.
    
- Simplify (and fix) logging configuration
    
  The code that configured logging was overly complex, and also buggy.  These changes
  simplify it, keep duplicate messages from being emitted, and properly allow per-module
  configuration of log level.
  
- Don't use inspect.isclass

  When testing to see if an object is a class, use type() instead of inpect.isclass. See
  the comment on appmap._implementation.recording.is_class for details.  Also, make sure
  ConfigFilter.wrap doesn't call the next filter for a function that it finds has already
  been wrapped.

### Fixed
- Fix classmap `function` entries

  Entries of type `function` in the classmap must have an attribute called "location", not
  "path" and "lineno" attributes. Now they do.

- Fix support for function exclusions specified in the config.

## [0.1.0.dev4] - 2021-01-11
### Added
- Add a deploy stage to the build
  With these changes, tagged versions will now be deployed to PyPI.
- Set the version from the git tag
  Before pushing a release, set the version based on the tag for the
  current build.

## [0.1.0.dev3] - 2021-01-09
### Added
- Configure stream for logging
  Allow the user to specify which stream (stdout, stderr) to use for
  logging. Also, raise a RuntimeError if an `excludes` attribute in
  `appmap.yml` is something other than an array.

### Changed
- Avoid recursion when inspecting a call's receiver.
  To generate a call event, `str()` and `repr()` are used to create the
  `receiver` attribute. These methods may have been instrumented, or may
  call instrumented methods. These changes add protection to make sure
  we avoid infinite recursion.
- Simplify classmap classes
  ClassMapDict now just subclasses dict, and ClassMapEntry and its
  subclasses are all dataclasses.
  Also fix a couple of minor issues identified during review. Thanks
  @virajkanwade for the suggestions.

### Fixed
- Handle missing source info
  Make sure we can generate CallEvents even if `inspect` can't find the
  source or line number information.
- Reinitialize implementation before each test
  Make sure appmap._implementation.initialize gets called before each
  test, to start with a clean slate. To make this easier, package the
  tests in classes that inherit from a base class that implements
  setup_method.
- Fix handling of sys.meta_path
  The elements of sys.meta_path can be either classes or objects. These
  changes ensure that instances are handled correctly. When an instance is
  encountered, its find_spec method will be wrapped. Additionally, it will
  be marked to ensure that it won't be wrapped again if it's revisited.

## [v0.1.0.dev1] - 2021-01-08
### Added
- Add package mgmt, linting, and testing. Use poetry to manage dependencies, pylint for linting, and pytest for
testing. Also adds a Travis config to run them all.
- Completely rework recording. Generates AppMaps with `metadata`, `event`, and `classMap`
  sections. Currently missing significant parts of each, but they're complete enough to
  upload to [https://app.land](https://app.land).
- Add contributor documentation
- Deploy release to PyPI
